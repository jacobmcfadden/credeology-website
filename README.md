This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Idea and Users

What problems does this app solve?
It allows users and companies to connect, while allowing full business management capability.

How does it solve those problems?
It accomplishes this by allowing businesses to create relationships with other businesses or business professionals. Businesses can then track everything going on from start to finish allowing them to make better desicions based on the data recorded as a whole.

Who is the target user?
Any business or business professional.

How much experience does the user have with technology?
Should be all ranges but will be designed with the least tech savey user in mind.
